### :nerd_face: About me :rainbow_flag:  :heart: :sushi: :chocolate_bar: :coffee: :rainbow_flag:

I am Brazilian but I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I have been passionate about IT for many years, but I don't know why crazy in my head I decided to study International Relations. After 4 years of studying this area, I realized that: what I loved was always in front of me, and, why I never considered studying it? Now, here I am! Dedicating myself to learning every day a little more about that huge world that is the data science field.  


I will dedicate this space to share course and event projects that I am doing, as well as to get ready projects, refactor what is possible, give a little touch of mine, and also share my own models. I hope you like that and can learn and share some experiences. 






### Technologies that I'm learning :computer: :

```Py
def data_science():
    name = 'Bianca Amorim'
    code = ['python', 'R'],
    tools = ['Power BI', 'git', 'github', 'GNU/linux','Azure', 'haddop', 'Spark', 'TensorFlow', ]
    return "My name is %s I am learning %s and %s" %(name, code, tools)

data_science()
```
