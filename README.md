### :nerd_face: About me :rainbow_flag:  :heart: :sushi: :chocolate_bar: :coffee: 


:triangular_flag_on_post: I am looking for challenging work where I can aggregate value and develop my skills.

I am a Data Science student with a passion for programming, machine learning, and storytelling. I am a proactive professional with problem-solving skills, great self-discipline and always looking to improve processes and bring new ideas wherever I work. I have learned several subjects such as python, Power BI, machine learning, and statistics.


Experience in Scripting and Business Intelligence:
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Scikit-learn) 
- Microsoft PowerBI (building dashboards)
- SQL and PostgreSQL
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Docker
- Git - GitHub



---

I will dedicate this space to share course and event projects that I am doing, as well as to get ready projects, refactor what is possible, give a little touch of mine, and also share my own projects. I hope you like that and can learn and share some experiences. 

ðŸ¤“ I am a lifelong learner who loves to get out of my comfort zone and do my best. ðŸ“š
