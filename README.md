I have learned several subjects such as python, Power BI, machine learning, and statistics.


### Experience in Scripting and Business Intelligence

- Microsoft PowerBI (building dashboards)
- SQL and PostgreSQL
- Apache Spark (PySpark)
- Docker

:triangular_flag_on_post: I am looking for a challenging job where I can aggregate value and develop my skills.

I will dedicate this space to share course and event projects that I am doing, as well as to get ready projects, refactor what is possible, give a little touch of mine, and also share my own projects. I hope you like that and can learn and share some experiences. 

ðŸ¤“ I am a lifelong learner who loves to get out of my comfort zone and do my best. ðŸ“š :coffee:
