### :nerd_face: About me :rainbow_flag:  :heart: :sushi: :chocolate_bar: :coffee: 

I am a lifelong learner who loves to get out of my comfort zone and do my best.

I will dedicate this space to share course and event projects that I am doing, as well as to get ready projects, refactor what is possible, give a little touch of mine, and also share my own models. I hope you like that and can learn and share some experiences. 






### Technologies that I'm learning :computer: :

```Py
def data_science():
    name = 'Bianca Amorim'
    code = ['python', 'R'],
    tools = ['Power BI', 'git', 'github', 'GNU/linux', 'VSCode', 'PyCharm', 'Jupyter notebook']
    return "My name is %s I am learning %s and %s" %(name, code, tools)

data_science()
```
